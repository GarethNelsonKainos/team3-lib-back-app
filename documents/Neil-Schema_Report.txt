Schema Report - Book Library Web App

Overview
The schema is designed for PostgreSQL and follows the provided requirements without adding unspecified fields or features. It supports book catalog management, copy tracking, member management, and borrowing transactions, with normalized structures for authors and genres.

Key Design Decisions
1) Normalization for Authors and Genres
- Authors are stored in an authors table and linked to books through book_authors (many-to-many).
- Genres are stored in a genres table and linked to books through book_genres (many-to-many).
- This matches the requirement to normalize and supports searching/filtering and analytics without duplication.

2) Book and Copy Separation
- books stores bibliographic data (title, ISBN, publication year, description).
- copies stores physical instances with unique copy identifiers and availability status.
- ISBN is unique per book. Copy identifiers are unique across the collection.

3) Member Data
- members includes the required fields only: name, contact information, address, member ID, join date, expiry date.
- member_identifier is unique to enforce membership uniqueness.

4) Transactions
- A single transactions table captures check-out and return events using checkout timestamp, due date, and optional return timestamp.
- No late fee data is included since it is not specified in the requirements.

5) Constraints and Integrity
- Foreign keys enforce valid relationships (e.g., transaction to member and copy).
- Status on copies is limited to Available/Borrowed as required.
- Basic consistency check ensures return time is not earlier than checkout time.

High-Level Data Model
- books (1)---(M) copies
- books (M)---(M) authors via book_authors
- books (M)---(M) genres via book_genres
- members (1)---(M) transactions
- copies (1)---(M) transactions

Notes on Business Rules
Borrowing limits, overdue restrictions, and deletion rules are best enforced at the application or procedure level, as the requirements describe policy behavior rather than schema-only constraints.
